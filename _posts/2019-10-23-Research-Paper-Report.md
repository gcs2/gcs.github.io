In Perception of Musical Cooperation in Jazz Duets is Predicted by Social Aptitude, Pesquita, Corlis, and Enns explore the ways that live collaboration can be recognized by people with low or high social aptitude or people with low or high skill level in musicianship. The experimenters rely heavily on the logic of configural perception, where “[a] composite with an emergent property is formed when the combination of a context and an element results in a stimulus that is more discriminable than the elements on their own” (175). In other words, in a collaborative environment, the sum is greater than its parts, and the combination of elements gives rise to something different. Applied to music, certain emotional qualities may be found when artists collaborate and engage with one another, “with the aim of creating a joint auditory Gestalt” (173). The experimenters first wanted to see if listeners could distinguish a live from a non live performance. From this, three conditions emerge: a live duet condition, a dub duet condition, where a musician plays to a pre-recorded track, and a mix track, where two pre-recorded tracks from different sessions were put together. Listeners with a known level of musical competence would guess whether the recording they listened to was live or not, and then were asked to take the 50-question Autism Quotient test to gauge their level of social aptitude and empathy. The findings of this experiment show that listeners were on the whole able to tell the live recordings from non-live. Interestingly, in the case of musical novices, individuals with higher social scores were better able to judge live recordings than those with lower social scores. However, this effect was not observed in those individuals with musical training. In a subsequent experiment, listeners were tasked with judging the positive aspects of these duets along four dimensions: Emotion, Engagement, Synergy, and Creativity. Here, live recordings were better rated on all dimensions, particularly synergy. 

I found the results and methodology of this study to be very relevant to Harmonee, particularly because a major goal of the app is to promote people who can bring the most collaborative potential out of each other. Given what we know now about the relationship that social aptitude has to the recognition of collaboration in live duets, it would be interesting to have users partake in a social aptitude test similar to the Autism Quotient. This is an element that was absent from our previous design for individual user profile creation and band member matching. Comparing social ability with their self-reported skill level as musicians, this could give us an idea of how to better judge their collaborative ability. This becomes especially important in the search for those individuals best suited to be band leaders who can use their enhanced collaborative or social abilities to take on their additional responsibilities (speaking to audiences, communicating with studios or gig patrons, etc.). So social aptitude can play a significant role in the screening process for both band formation and maintenance. Harmonee can build on this by adapting the weight of social ability against musical ability to find an optimal balance between these forces that maximizes group satisfaction in retrospectives on match events.
