![82 Grill Toppings Menu](/img/bad_design.jpeg)

82 Grill is a wonderful place for students to meet up, talk, and eat good food. Their toppings menu, however, is not as stellar as the service.

The most egregious aspect of the menu is the lack of contrast between the text and background. Black text on a dark blue field was a bad choice and makes it much harder to read compared to, say, black and white. This has caused problems for me since there is time pressure when standing in line and I always seem to forget at the last minute what toppings I want on my nachos. Not to mention the fact that the low light at 82 makes it even more difficult to read, which is a concern especially for people who are visually impaired. In this case, the bad design is getting in the way of accomplishing the topping menu's intended goal. A higher contrast menu would be much better at conveying the information.

From an aesthetic standpoint, the clip art adds a certain local charm to 82 Grill, but the white background makes it clear that this was something slapped together in as little time as possible. Once again, a white background would solve the issue. Honestly, the pictures themselves could go since they serve no purpose; the resulting space could be used to increase the spacing between toppings, further increasing readability.
