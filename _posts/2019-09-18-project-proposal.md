#Domestic Robotics

## Motivation

Nobody likes to do household chores, yet we all understand that it's something that must be done. According to data from the American Time Use Survey, American homeowners spend about 10
hours per week on household activities. That means that over a 65 year period, we spend over 4 years on chores alone. This kind
of work (dishes, vacuuming, laundry, scrubbing floors) can be physically taxing, especially for older populations. The topic of
elderly care also is a growing concern as populations continue to age in many developed countries. In emergencies such as a fall
or heart attack, rapid recognition and response is crucial for survival. The same applies to home security emergencies like
break-ins and robberies. In addition, as the share of two-parent households where both parents work full time continues to 
rise, finding a trustworthy babysitter could prove to be challenging.

## Solution

I propose to use advanced robotics to help alleviate and solve the aformentioned domestic problems, deployed in various stages. Using computer vision and machine learning models, a domestic robot could feasibly wash dishes, clean, iron, and fold laundry, vacuum and dust spaces, change light bulbs and carbon monoxide sensors, and much more. While the features at this stage may sound just like a "Rosie the Robot Maid from the Jetsons," the implications and potential of this robot go much further. As machine learning models improve and the robots are exposed to various scenarios and data sets, they could be trained to recognize more advanced and nuanced scenarios, such as if the owner is having a heart attack. In addition to calling an ambulance immediately, the robot would be able to respond appropriately by applying CPR to the victim. These features could be used in a variety of emergency situations in order to stop someone from choking, bleeding, and using facial recognition to identify known users, strangers, and potential threats. Much like home surveillance systems, users would be receive reports of unusual activity. These solutions have the potential to save lives and avoid unnecessary pain and loss. Two parent households could also benefit from robot help by providing babysitting services without the worries of trust issues, scheduling conflicts, or safety training. It could also be conceivable that these robots could provide animal and pet care when necessary.
