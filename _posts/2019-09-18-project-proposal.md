#Domestic Robotics

## Motivation

Nobody likes to do household chores, yet we all understand that it's something that must be done. According to data from the American Time Use Survey, American homeowners spend about 10

break-ins and robberies. In addition, as the share of two-parent households where both parents work full time continues to 
rise, finding a trustworthy babysitter could prove to be challenging.

## Solution

I propose to use advanced robotics to help alleviate and solve the aformentioned domestic problems, deployed in various stages.
The first stage would be
