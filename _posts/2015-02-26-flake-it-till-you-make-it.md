Here is something all Williams students are familiar with, yet probably don't give any thought. The system for badging in for doors on campus is very robust. I haven't had any reliability issues with it, and it does exactly what you would expect it to do. When no badge is detected, a blue light displays, signalling that the device is ready. Once a badge is in proximity, the device emits a pleasant beeping sound and the color of the light shifts to green for the duration that the door is unlocked. This is important, since the door will re-lock after a set amount of time to maintain security.
